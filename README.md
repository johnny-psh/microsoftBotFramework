# microsoftBotFramework

This project utilize the Microsoft Bot Framework together with LUIS to understand human language and respond appropriately. I use the telegrm bot to communicate with the bot. This is a simple bus timing search time that uses the LTA API to get the information and print it to the user in a simple and readable format.
